# Modelling-Risk-Factors-and-Time-Lags-in-Disease-Incidence-Prediction
The code models the risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) by generating a synthetic dataset of 1,000 individuals with varying risk factors such as age, sex, deprivation index, alcohol consumption, smoking, and obesity. It estimates time lags between exposure to risk factors and disease onset using a shifted binomial distribution. The model calculates combined relative risks (RR) for individuals, considering factors like obesity and smoking, and adjusts the CHD incidence based on these RRs. The final dataset provides personalized risk predictions, accounting for time lags and risk factors. This framework aids in predictive health modelling and can inform targeted interventions for disease prevention.
